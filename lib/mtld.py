    Text length measured in words is divided by a segment count.
    Segments are computed by starting from a word and calculating the
    TTR for growing sequences beginning from this word on.
    As soon as the sequence's TTR is lower than 0.72 a new segment
    is started.
    The two MTLD values of the sequence and the reversed sequence
    are computed and their mean is returned as the final MTLD value.
