For these reasons, I venture to address this little Pamphlet to
your Lordship's consideration.  I am quite conscious that the
outlines I have drawn, afford but a very imperfect description of
the feelings they are intended to illustrate; but I claim for them
one merit--their truth and freedom from exaggeration.  I may have
fallen short of the mark, but I have never overshot it:  and while
I have pointed out what appears to me, to be injustice on the part
of others, I hope I have carefully abstained from committing it
myself.
