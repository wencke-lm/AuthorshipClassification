Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I 'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Could n't keep it in , heaven knows I 've tried
Do n't let them in , do n't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal , do n't feel , do n't let them know
Well , now they know
